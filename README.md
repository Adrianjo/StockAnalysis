Is this worth looking into?

https://github.com/jeog/TOSDataBridge
TOSDataBridge (TOSDB) is an open-source collection of resources for pulling real-time streaming data off of TDAmeritrade's ThinkOrSwim(TOS) platform, providing C, C++, Java and Python interfaces. ... The core implementation is not portable, but the python interface does provides a thin virtualization layer over TCP.

It looks like that library requires a local installation of thinkorswim. I have a TDAmeritrade account, and can download thinkorswim, but I don't think I can share the program.

I found [IEX Trading](https://iextrading.com/developer/docs/), an open access stock data API. It has real-time and historical timeseries data. It seems other people have already written libraries to use the API, including six written in Python. We could look through those and see which is flexible enough for our uses.
